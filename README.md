## Current Languages:

* Python
* SQL
* R

## Planned Additions:

* Java
* JavaScript

## Content Structure:

Each subfolder is dedicated to a specific programming language. The code samples within these folders are primarily for my own learning journey, but hopefully they can serve as a helpful reference for fellow beginners.

## Sources:

* Python: Primarily from the "100 Days of Python" course by Dr. Angela Yu
* R:  Code samples from my personal thesis work
* SQL: Samples inspired by the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Data Engineering
