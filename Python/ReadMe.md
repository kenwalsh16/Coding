# Welcome to the Python Folder!

This folder contains code samples I'm using to learn and practice Python. It's organized by source, with subfolders for various courses, books, and personal projects.

Here's an overview of the current subfolders:

* **100 Days of Python (Dr. Angela Yu):** Code samples from the "100 Days of Python" course.
* **The Self-Taught Programmer (Cory Althoff):** Code examples from the book "The Self-Taught Programmer".
* (Add entries for other sources here)
* **Personal Projects:** My personal Python projects.

Please refer to the individual subfolder Readme files for more detailed information about the course/book and specific code samples.

Feel free to explore and learn alongside me!
